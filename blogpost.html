      <p>Good to be with <strong>Lighthouse</strong> in the parttime course!</p>
      <p><span style="color: purple">I'm looking forward to building a web page.</span></p>
      <p><strong>Congratulations</strong>, you've built your <em>first</em> HTML page! It doesn't look like much right now, but you can see both by looking at it in your browser, and by looking at the HTML, that the content is organized into blocks. This is important, because that is also how search engines like Google see your content. Logical blocks, organized by what tag they are in, with headers determining the most important pieces of data.</p>

      <p>We've built a <em>stylesheet</em> for you so that you can see this content come to life. There are a few different options for you. Copy and paste one of the link tags below into the of your document, and then save and reload your page.</p>
